      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        	The Indigenous workforce is becoming an increasingly relevant demographic in the labour market that faces unique challenges, despite only making roughly 5% [1] of the Canadian population. The Indigenous population is made up from different tribes of people. The most populous and studied are the First Nations (58.0%), Metis (34.5%), and Inuit (3.9%) peoples, who tend to be centred in different geographic regions [10]. First Nations and Metis people tend to live in Western Canadian provinces, while Inuit people live in the broad geographic region Innuit Nunugat, which consists of the three territories, northern Quebec, and northern Labrador [3]. Additionally, they are likely to live in a remote or very remote region, with a third living on a reserve [3]. On average, they are a lot younger than their non-Indigenous counterparts and their population is increasing quicker than non-Indigenous Canadians [4], meaning that it is important to understand the challenges Indigenous people face as more of them replace the aging non-Indigenous population in the workplace [3]. 
        <br></br><br></br>
          Despite this, the participation and employment still remains lower than the Canadian average [4]. Specifically, many of the challenges faced by Indigenous people are unique due to the ugly history of their treatment at the hands of the Canadian government. This includes colonial trauma (generational trauma caused by residential schools, systemic racism, etc.), long lasting government policy, and geographic remoteness [3]. Studying trends in Indigenous demographics and spreading awareness is part of the Canadian government’s Truth and Reconciliation Committee's educational goal of informing the public [3]. Furthermore, Indigenous people are one of the four protected groups under the Employment Equity Act, which aims to achieve equality in the workplace so that no person is denied employment opportunities or benefits for reasons unrelated to ability [3]. The Truth and Reconciliation program is working to help indigenous self-determination, recognizing and promoting Indigenous ways of knowing, being and doing, and self-government [4]. Investments are also being made in health, social, and educational services [4].

          The purpose of this article is to serve as a primer when it comes to Indigenous employment issues to highlight the issues Indigenous people face in the labour market and simplify research so that the general public can understand. It compares Indigenous and non-Indigenous people along key issues in the labour market such as educational attainment, employment rate, income, sector, gender-based inequalities, and more. It also analyses the differences between First Nations, Metis, and Inuit people to gain further insight into the complexity of the factors that influence Indigenous workers. Since this article is only a primer, it is strongly recommended that the user solidify their understanding using our interactive data visualization tools and, with their newfound knowledge about indigenous challenges, seek further reading. The data in this article are mainly sourced from Statistics Canada, which also contains further statistics and readings about indigenous challenges in the labour force.

      <h1>Education</h1>
      <p>
          In general, education is closely related to employment, especially for Indigenous people, where it has been shown to be a larger factor than for non-Indigenous people [2]. A major problem is that Indigenous people continue to face obstacles in education, and by extension, employment. Some sources for the gap in educational quality include a lack of culturally relevant curricula, implicit and explicit racism and discrimination, and intergenerational trauma [2].
        <br></br><br></br>
          Education quality and rates for Indigenous people is improving, but it still lags behind in comparison to the other demographics [2]. The gap in attaining high-school education between indigenous and non-indigenous people has narrowed since 2016, but the gap in attaining post-secondary education has widened [3]. This is despite the education rate among Indigenous people increasing since 2016,because the education rate among non-Indigenous people has increased faster [3]. The main cause of this discrepancy is believed to be the remoteness of most Indigenous people [2]. Remote regions have less resources and less post secondary opportunities than urban economic centres, meaning that Indigenous people often have to uproot themselves from their support systems and experience culture shock when moving far away from home to pursue education [3]. Living on a reserve is thus also associated with lower income and higher employment rates [3]. 57% of Inuit graduates, 33% of First Nations graduates, and 22% of Metis graduates reported having lived in a “remote” or “very remote” area during sometime from 2016 to 2021, which is far higher compared to the fact that only 10% of non-Indigenous graduates live in “remote” or “very remote” areas [3]. Importantly, this shows how the remoteness of different indigenous groups vary with respect to each other. Metis are the most remote, as most live in Inuit Nunangat, which is in remote northern regions, whereas First Nations and Metis people live in more populated Western provinces. In short, the challenges faced by most Indigenous people who obtain an education include travel and uprooting themselves.
        <br></br><br></br>
          In recent years, the prevalence of pursuing university education among Indigenous people has been gradually increasing [2]. Bachelor’s degree attainment (and in general, post secondary educational patterns) show trends that are unique to indigenous people. The share of Indigenous people with a credential below the level of bachelor’s hasn’t changed since 2016, but the percentage of Indigenous people with a bachelor’s has increased [2]. It is important to note that this may be positively influenced by mobility bias, which in this case is the tendency of Indigenous people to self-report as Indigenous on censuses only after credential attainment [2]. Despite this, the gap between the rate of bachelor’s holders among Indigenous people and the rate of bachelor’s holders among non-Indigenous people has only grown since 2016 [2]. 3% of bachelor’s holders are Indigenous, despite making up 5% of the Canadian population, showing that Indigenous people are underrepresented in education at the bachelor’s level or higher [3]. Interestingly, the rate of women among Indigenous bachelor’s holders is higher than that of women among Indigenous non-bachelor’s holders [3]. These women also tended to be older and have more dependent children on average [3]. It is common to see Indigenous women represented better in higher education than Indigenous men. Of bachelor’s degree holders, Indigenous women tended to pursue the same degrees as their non-Indigenous counterparts [3], and 47.6% were First Nations, 47.3% were Metis, 1.5% were Inuit, and 2.5% were from other groups [1]. Compared with the population of First Nations, Metis, and Inuit people (58.0%, 34.5%, 3.9%, respectively,) Metis people are overrepresented among Indigenous bachelor’s holders while First Nations and Metis are underrepresented. This is mainly attributable to geographic remoteness of First Nations people, who mainly live on reserves, and Inuit people from Inuit Nunangat [2]. Apart from being underrepresented, First Nations bachelor’s holders tended to have lower income than non-Indigenous bachelor’s holders, while Metis tended to have slightly higher income than non-Indigenous bachelor’s holders [1]. Indigenous representation at higher levels of education is far from equal to non-Indigenous Canadians, but it has been improving over time. The data also suggests that there are great variances in education and income among different groups of Indigenous people, which points to remoteness being one of the key issues facing Indigenous people entering the workforce.
        <br></br><br></br>
          The educational levels of the Indigenous population varies from the non-Indigenous population. It is more common for Indigenous people across all ages to hold educational credentials below a bachelor’s level. Across all Indigenous groups, completion of a college, CEGEP or other non-university certificate or diploma was the most commonly reported highest level of educational attainment for those who had completed a post secondary qualification [2]. Analysing trends among Indigenous people with lower level post secondary qualifications is important, because many of the same trends among their bachelor’s holders counterparts are present, showing that the issue of educational attainment is more systemic and universal among all groups of Indigenous people, regardless of socioeconomic factors (age, physical distance from institute, gender, etc.). Still, lower level post-secondary education is lacking among Indigenous compared to non-Indigenous people, as only 49.2% of Indigenous people aged 25-64 have completed post secondary education, compared to 68.0% of their respective non-Indigenous counterparts [2]. Similarly, completion rates were much higher for those living in economic centres compared to those living in remote areas [2]. The most pronounced difference was for Inuit people, where Inuit people living outside of Inuit Nunugat are five times more likely to have completed post secondary education [2]. The variation is more complicated among First Nations people, depending on whether they have Registered or Treaty Indian status, whether they live on or off reserve, or depending on where they live [2]. In general, there is a greater educational attainment rate among those living off reserve, mainly because roughly three in five living on reserve live in remote areas [2]. Interestingly, younger people tended to live on a reserve more often. 16% of recent First Nations graduates lived on a reserve at some point between 2016 to 2021, whereas that number is 27% among recent First Nations graduates aged 25-34 [3]. Similarly, among recent Inuit graduates, roughly a third lived in Inuit Nunangat at some point between 2016 and 2021, whereas 70% of graduates aged 25-34 lived there [3]. Educational attainment has increased for all Indigenous groups, where it is most pronounced for those living in economic centres. Similarly, women tended to complete post secondary education at a higher rate than men, with a higher gap between the completion rates of non-Indigenous men compared with non-Indigenous women [2]. This is possibly attributed to the greater gender difference among Indigenous people compared to non-Indigenous people [2].
        <br></br><br></br>
          Education is especially important to analyse and understand for Indigenous people because its benefits have been shown to have a greater impact for Indigenous people [9]. In 2021, the Indigenous employment rate across Canada was 61.2%, which was 10% lower than the non-Indigenous employment rate [2]. When only looking only at non-post secondary attainers, the difference in employment rates (from non-Indigenous employment rates?) was much more pronounced, while the difference was almost nonexistent among post secondary attainers [2]. In general, Indigenous people with a bachelor’s are much more likely to be employed than Indigenous people without a bachelor’s, with the disparity varying among different Indigenous groups but being largest with First Nations people [2]. 13.2% of all Indigenous people were unemployed, which is double the amount of the 5.9% unemployment rate among Indigenous people who hold a bachelor’s, who are unemployed at the same rate as non-Indigenous bachelor’s holders. Interestingly, for Indigenous people with a bachelor’s and Registered or Treaty Indian status, living on or off reserve didn’t affect employment, although they were slightly likelier to be unemployed than their non Registered or Treaty Indian status (6.7% vs 5.9%) [2]. The same trend was observed among Inuit with a bachelor’s who did or did not live in Inuit Nunangat. Despite the huge difference in employment for Indigenous people who have a bachelor’s versus those who don’t, the quality of jobs for all Indigenous people still remains lower than the general population of non-Indigenous people. In 2021, the rate of Indigenous people who worked in TEER 1 (occupations that usually require a university degree) jobs was lower than for non-Indigenous people. For Indigenous people, pay rates and earnings have been shown to be vastly higher for those educated than those not [2], which may be attributable to this disparity. Since Indigenous women were represented more in higher education compared to Indigenous men, Indigenous women were twice as likely to work in a TEER 1 job than Indigenous men, whereas Indigenous men were more likely to work in a TEER 2 job than their female counterparts [2]. As expected, when only considering the population of bachelor's holders, the difference in TEER 1 and TEER 2 jobs between Indigenous people and non-Indigenous people almost disappeared [2].
        <br></br><br></br>
          While it has been clearly shown that educational attainment helps greatly with labour market success among Indigenous people, the issue is still systemically challenging for them in a twofold way. Firstly, it was shown that educational attainment is much more difficult for Indigenous people for a variety of reasons. Secondly, Indigenous people have lower employment rates (with the exception of bachelor’s holders, who have roughly the same employment rate) and hold  lower educational requirement positions than their non-Indigenous counterparts. It is important to raise awareness of the complexity of these issues, since there’s not one easy fix that could bring equality. It will have to be a more systemic change.

      <h1>Employment</h1>
      <p>
          It is important to begin with a brief comparison of employment rates between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Indigenous employment has continued to rise regardless of hardships. The COVID-19 pandemic dropped employment rates across the board for all people, but there has been a noticeable upward trend for Indigenous people since [2], where Indigenous bachelor’s holders tended to keep their jobs compared with Indigenous people without a bachelor’s [3]. From 2021 to 2022, the number of  jobs held by Indigenous workers increased by 29.7%, which was higher than the general population, which was 12.2% [5]. The jobs where Indigenous people outpaced the most tended to be in health care and social assistance, public administration, and retail [5].
        <br></br><br></br>
          Indigenous people have differing employment characteristics than non-Indigenous people, and compared amongst themselves. An interesting characteristic is the age of Indigenous workers. From 2012 to 2022, the share of Indigenous jobs held by those aged 15-24 trended down while jobs held by those aged 45+ trended upwards [5]. Specifically, in the public administration sector, the increase in jobs held by ages 45+ was ten times greater than those held by ages 15-24 [5]. This is problematic due to the younger average age of the Indigenous population, thus posing concerns over the future of Indigenous people new to the workforce and building a career. It may also be attributable that from 2012 to 2022, the share of Indigenous employment in the trades has been decreasing and the share among Indigenous educated employment has increased [5], which may reveal a trend of older, more financially stable Indigenous people returning to education (as evidenced by the higher education rates among older Indigenous people, discussed in the education section). Other than age, the share in part- versus full-time employment and male versus female representation hasn’t changed in the same 10 year time period [5]. Strong sector of employment trends can be seen when observing the Indigenous population. Indigenous people are most likely to hold a degree in science or education [3]. Indigenous people were also less likely to work in management positions, and when they did, they were most likely to work in middle management positions for the trades, transportation, production, and utilities compared to non-Indigenous people [6].
        <br></br><br></br>
          Due to the differences in field and in education, the incomes of Indigenous people tend to be different from their non-Indigenous counterparts. These differences are also visible within the different Indigenous groups, where Metis workers tend to have higher incomes than other Indigenous groups. Two years after graduation, Metis graduates had similar incomes to their non-Indigenous counterparts, while First Nations and Inuit recent graduates had lower income [3]. When taking into account differences in industry, education, and demographic, Indigenous women made 4% less money on average compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts, while Indigenous men made 7% less money on average compared to non-Indigenous men [3]. Indigenous income, measured using the GDI (gross domestic income) of the Indigenous population, has dramatically been increasing. From 2021-2022, the Indigenous GDI increased by 9.8% [5]. The Indigenous economic contribution has been increasing faster than the general Canadian population’s. From 2012 to 2022, the Indigenous GDI increased by 74.7%, which is 54 percentage points higher than the rest of Canada’s GDI increase from 2012 to 2022 [5]. The most growth has come from public administration and construction sectors (although this may be attributed to their overall growth in Ontario and British Columbia [5]) and the fastest growth has happened in the arts, entertainment and recreation, mining and quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sectors [5]. In 2022, In every province and territory, Indigenous GDI has increased, the largest increases happening in Nunavut, Ontario, and Alberta [5]. The highest contributing province to the Indigenous GDI was Manitoba while the lowest was Prince Edward Island, and for the territories it was Nunavut and Yukon, respectively [5]. Although Indigenous GDI  has been growing quickly with the rise in Indigenous jobs, Indigenous workers’ income still remains below the general Canadian populations. The Indigenous GDI only accounted for 2.4% of the Canadian GDI [5], which is underrepresentative considering that Indigenous people make up 5% of Canada’s population. First Nations workers reported lower pay more often than non-Indigenous workers, while Metis workers had the same rates as non-Indigenous workers [6]. Even Indigenous workers living off reserve on average had a lower hourly wage than non-Indigenous workers, much of which can be attributed to differences in education, gender, and age [6]. This disparity may hint that most Indigenous people don't have access to the same resources as everyone else.
        <br></br><br></br>
          The more general way of comparing jobs is by using quality of employment (QoE) measures. Most studies use seven dimensions to describe someone's QoE: safety and ethics of employment, income and benefits from employment, working time and work-life balance, security of employment and social protection, social dialogue, skills development and training, and employment-related relationships and work motivation [3]. Beyond employment, QoE can also be used to measure the overall health and well-being of a population [6]. Income is sometimes the only metric covered, but for populations like Indigenous Canadians, who often face discrimination, limited access to education and resources, and historical marginalization [6], analysing the other QoE metrics can help illuminate the problems they face. QoE is especially important because it's often influenced by demographic characteristics and sector of employment [3], which makes it especially useful for analysing minority groups like Indigenous people. Taking into account all QoE metrics when comparing the Indigenous and non-Indigenous population, it becomes clear just how prevalent discrimination against Indigenous people is. Pension coverage among Indigenous people varied greatly. Metis tended to have higher EPP (executive pension plans) rates than non-Indigenous people (the difference disappeared once demographic, education, and industry characteristics were factored), while First Nations had lower EPP rates [3]. Indigenous people tend to face implicit and explicit discrimination and harassment, as they are more likely to report unfair treatment and discrimination in the workplace than non-Indigenous people [6]. Furthermore, Indigenous people were three times as likely to report workplace sexual harassment than non-Indigenous people [6]. Indigenous people tended to have a less stable work-life balance, as they were less likely than non-Indigenous people to report having a flexible work schedule that allows them to choose when their day begins and ends [6]. First Nations workers also tended to report working irregular shifts at higher rates than non-Indigenous people [6]. This could be attributed to work environments, as Indigenous people who worked from home were three times more likely to report having flexible work schedules than those working on premises [6]. Indigenous people also tended to work full-time jobs less and have lower job security more often than non-Indigenous people. 26.2% of First Nations people reported working part-time involuntarily, compared with 18.6% of non-Indigenous people [6]. Also, First Nations people living off reserve and Metis people had higher rates of short tenure jobs (contracts that lasted less than 12 months) compared to non-Indigenous people [6]. Tenure of 10 years or more was common in the public administration, finance and insurance, and health care and social assistance sectors [6]. Unionization rates varied among the different Indigenous groups and among gender and profession. Interestingly, Metis people tended to have higher unionization rates than non-Indigenous people [3] and higher collective bargaining rates than non-Indigenous people (although Indigenous groups across the board had similar or higher rates of collective bargaining compared with non-Indigenous people) [6]. Indigenous women tended to have higher unionization rates compared to their male counterparts, which is mainly attributed to their higher tendency to work in public sector jobs [3]. From Indigenous graduates from 2010 to 2018, 70% of women and 40% of men worked in public sectors [3]. Due to this, Indigenous women were likelier to be covered by a collective agreement than Indigenous men [3]. In general, it can be seen that Metis workers tended to have similar QoE measurements as non-Indigenous people, while First Nations and other groups tended to have significantly lower ones.
        <br></br><br></br>
          Due to rapidly rising infrastructure developments, demand in the skilled trades has been on the increase in recent years [4]. However, waning enrollment in apprenticeship programs have not kept up with that demand [4], especially among Indigenous workers, who are often well represented in the trades [7]. The number of new male Indigenous journeypersons entering the workforce has slightly fluctuated from 2010 to 2020, while for women, the number of new journeypersons entering the workforce has remained relatively stable [6]. Indigenous people made up roughly 4% of the journeyperson population, which was similar to the 5% share they made up in the Canadian population [4]. Analysing Indigenous trades workers is important because it reveals new information about the demographic who don’t pursue higher education or those who work in TEER 0 or TEER 1 jobs. It is important to make the distinction between the two different paths to entering the trades. The first way is to complete apprenticeship training through an apprenticeship program before challenging the trade certification exam [4]. The second way, for those who already have experience under their belt, is to skip apprenticeship training and directly challenge the trade certification exam, who are known as trade qualifiers [4]. Trade qualifiers tend to have a lower market value and lower salaries than journeypersons who complete formal training, who have a 5.5% higher median income, which can be due to  [4]. Indigenous people are more likely to complete training than to be trade qualifiers [4]. 20% of Indigenous journeymen and 11% of Indigenous journeywomen are trade qualifiers, compared with 30% and 19% of their respective non-Indigenous counterparts [4]. Important differences can also be found when comparing First Nations, Metis, and Inuit workers [7]. Most significantly, Metis people were much better represented in the trades than First Nations or Inuit people were [7]. In fact, despite making up only two fifths of the Indigenous population, Metis people made up over half of the Indigenous journeyperson population [4]. Similarly to non-Indigenous trades workers, Indigenous men were much more likely to complete a trade certification than Indigenous women, where Inuit men were less likely than other Indigenous men to complete a trade certification [2]. Indigenous male journeypersons were less likely to be unionized than their non-Indigenous counterparts, but this could be because most Indigenous journeypersons are situated in western Canada, which tends to have lower unionization rates [4]. However, female Indigenous journeypersons were more likely to be unionized than their non-Indigenous counterparts across the board [4]. Over half of all indigenous journeypersons are situated in the western provinces, most often in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, which is much higher than non-Indigenous journeypersons, who were most often situated in Ontario and Quebec [4]. However, Indigenous female journeypersons were more likely to be situated in Ontario due to the fact that Indigenous women tended to go into trades that didn’t have Red Seal endorsement (an official recognition of skill and knowledge on a trade certificate offered by the Canadian Council of Directors of Apprenticeship) and also due to Ontario’s female population size [4]. Not all Indigenous journeypersons are situated in the same places. Due to geographic regions, First Nations tended to be situated in Ontario, while Metis people were situated in the western provinces [4]. Notably, Indigenous people were much less likely to be situated in Quebec, which has lower income for the trades across the board [4]. As can be seen, QoE varies greatly by Indigenous groups, but it also varies across gender. Among male journeypersons, around half of non-Indigenous workers had their CPP (Canadian Pension Plan) covered by their employers, while only a quarter of Indigenous workers did [4]. Indigenous journeypersons also had higher interprovincial mobility, which is likely because interprovincial mobility is facilitated by the Red Seal program [4]. 81% of Indigenous journeypersons had Red Seal endorsement compared to 76% of non-Indigenous journeypersons, which likely contributes to the higher median income of non-trade qualifiers [4]. Type of trade varies greatly between genders and slightly between Indigenous and non-Indigenous journeypersons. Among both Indigenous and non-Indigenous male journeypersons, the most common professions were in construction and in electrician work, while the most pronounced difference was that Indigenous male journeypersons were significantly more likely to be welders than non-Indigenous ones [4]. Among both Indigenous and non-Indigenous journeypersons, the most common profession for both was being a hairstylist [4]. Non-Indigenous women were more likely to be IT support assistants and Indigenous women, similar to their male counterparts, were significantly more likely to be welders [4]. Neither of these trades were in the top 10 most common trades for women (the top 10 trades for both groups consisted of the same professions) [4]. Indigenous men were more likely to go into trades with higher median incomes than their non-Indigenous counterparts, with Metis men going into higher median income trades compared to First Nations men, explaining the income difference between them [4]. For women, the gap in income between Indigenous and non-Indigenous journeypersons is not statistically significant [4]. When the choice of trade and type of certification is taken into consideration, then the gap becomes statistically significant [4]. Due to these career differences, the median male Indigenous journeyperson income is 2.5 times larger than the median female Indigenous journeyperson income ($74,980 vs. $30,920) [7]. This gap has not only persisted since 2010, but has been widening, with the largest disparity being $62,430 in 2017 [7]. Indigenous women are also severely underrepresented in the trades [7]. From 2010 to 2020, roughly 21,030 Indigenous journeypersons received their certification, only 16% being women. non-Indigenous women are similarly underrepresented, making up 13% of the non-Indigenous journeyperson population [7]. On top of this, Indigenous women tend to be barred from professional success by family conditions, as the rate of completers of apprenticeship programs who are women from single parent families or of young age is lower than the rate among non-completers [7].

      <h1>Women</h1>
      <p>The inclusion of women and some of the challenges women face have already been examined in other sections of this primer/ This section will explore those concepts in greater detail and highlight other concepts not yet mentioned.
	It is important to begin the section with a brief analysis of the gender pay gap, which is one of the most documented challenges women face in the workforce, with respect to Indigenous workers. The gender pay gap is key determinant of economic well-being and is considered symbolic of gender-based discrimination and injustice [6]. A similar wage gap was observed between Indigenous men and women and between non-Indigenous men and women, which has been narrowing in the last decade [3]. However, this narrowing may be confounded with industry differences between the genders, women’s greater tendency to work part time, and unmeasurable gender bias [3]. For Indigenous people, the gender gap was less pronounced, as two years after graduation, Metis women with a bachelor’s tended to earn more than their non-Indigenous counterparts, while corresponding First Nations women earned less [3]. After factoring in the effect of differences due to the graduates’ demographic, education and industry characteristics, the gap between first nations and non indigenous remained significant but the gap between metis and non indigenous didn’t [3].
	QoE metrics varied between Indigenous women and Indigenous men, as well as between Indigenous and non-Indigenous women. Metis women had higher unionization rates than non-Indigenous women [3]. In fact, women in general had higher unionization rates than men due to more of them working in public sector jobs [3]. Among graduates from 2010 to 2018, 70% of Indigenous women 40% of Indigenous men worked in the public sector, whereas 57% of non-Indigenous women and 26% of non-Indigenous men did [3]. Indigenous and non-Indigenous women in general were also more likely to be unionized than men, while unionization rates among Indigenous women varied when compared to non-Indigenous women [3]. Of bachelor’s degree graduates, 55% of non-Indigenous women, 46% of First Nations, and 64% of Metis women were unionized [3]. Indigenous women reported having higher bargaining power comparer to Indigenous men, whereas there was no statistically significant difference between non-Indigenous men and women [6]. Indigenous women were 2.6% less likely to work longer hours than Indigenous men [6]. However, Indigenous and non-Indigenous women were more likely to hold multiple jobs compared to men in general [6].
	It has been shown in other sections of this primer that remoteness is a large obstacle against career success, and the Indigenous female population is especially impacted. Indigenous women and girls are significantly overrepresented in the population of people who live in remote areas, as they make up 29% of that population [8]. Specifically, 13% of Metis women, 32% of First Nations women, and 80% of Inuit women live in remote areas [8]. Also, these women and girls tend to be much younger in age, averaging from ages 23-25 years, compared with non-Indigenous women who live in remote areas, averaged ages over 50 years [8]. Furthermore, Indigenous girls who lived remotely lived in poorer shelter conditions. Only 13% of First Nations women living in accessible areas were living in dwellings needing major repair, while 47% of First Nations women living remotely did [8]. A similar result is observed in Inuit women [8].
